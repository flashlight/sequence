*Flashlight Sequence* is a library with fast implementations of sequence-based operations. It includes:
- A fast, parallel CPU implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for greedy "`argmax`-style" decoding
- Fast implementations (CPU and CUDA) of the [Wav2letter ASG loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03193.pdf) function including the fully-connected and forced-alignment algorithms.

## Quickstart

Flashlight Sequence has Python bindings. To install the bindings from source, [optionally install CUDA] then clone the repo and build:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/flashlight/sequence && cd sequence
cd bindings/python
python setup.py install
```
To install with CUDA support, set the environment variable `USE_CUDA=1` when running the install command.

See the [full Python binding documentation](bindings/python) for examples and more.

## Building and Installing
[**From Source (C++)**](#building-from-source) | [**From Source (Python)**](bindings/python#build-instructions) | [**Adding to Your Own Project (C++)**](#adding-flashlight-sequence-to-a-c++-project)

### Requirements
At minimum, compilation requires:
- A C++ compiler with good C++17 support (e.g. gcc/g++ >= 7)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) â€” version 3.16 or later, and ``make``
- A Linux-based operating system.

**CUDA Support:** If building with CUDA support, CUDA >= 9 is recommended. To toggle CUDA support use the `FL_SEQUENCE_USE_CUDA` CMake option or the `USE_CUDA` environment variable when building the Python bindings.

**Tests:** If building tests, [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) >= 1.12 is required, but is installed automatically on build if not found. The `FL_SEQUENCE_BUILD_TESTS` CMake option toggles building tests.

Instructions for building/installing the Python bindings from source [can be found here](bindings/python/README.md).

### Building from Source

Building the C++ project from source is simple:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashlight/sequence && cd sequence
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
make test    # run tests
make install # install at the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
```
To enable CUDA while building, pass `-DFL_SEQUENCE_USE_CUDA=ON` to CMake. To disable building tests, pass `-DFL_SEQUENCE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`.

If building with CUDA < 11, [NVIDIA cub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub) is required. It will be downloaded automatically if not found; the `FL_SEQUENCE_BUILD_STANDALONE` build option controls this behavior.

### Adding Flashlight Sequence to a C++ Project

Given a simple `project.cpp` file that includes and links to Flashlight Sequence:
```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <flashlight/lib/sequence/criterion/cpu/ViterbiPath.h>

int main() {
  auto res = fl::lib::cpu::ViterbiPath<float>::compute(...);
  std::cout << "ViterbiPath result[0] " << res[0] << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```

The following CMake configuration links Flashlight and sets include directories:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(myProject project.cpp)

find_package(flashlight-sequence CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myProject PRIVATE flashlight::flashlight-sequence)
```
